/**
 * A cipher grille is a 4Ã—4 square of paper with four windows cut out.
 * Placing the grille on a paper sheet of the same size,
 * the encoder writes down the first four symbols of his password inside the windows (see fig. below).
 * After that, the encoder turns the grille 90 degrees clockwise.
 * The symbols written earlier become hidden under the grille and clean paper appears inside the windows.
 * The encoder then writes down the next four symbols of the password in the windows and turns the grille 90 degrees again.
 * Then, they write down the following four symbols and turns the grille once more.
 * Lastly, they write down the final four symbols of the password.
 * Without the same cipher grille, it is difficult to discern the password from the resulting square comprised of 16 symbols.
 * Thus, the encoder can be confident that no hooligan will easily gain access to the locked door.
 * Write a module that enables the robots to easily recall their passwords through codes when they return home.
 * 
 * Input: A cipher grille and a ciphered password as a tuples of strings.
 * Output: The password as a string.
